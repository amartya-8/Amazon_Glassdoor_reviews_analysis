Bay Area prices.Less Egregious Cons:- Working by Venice beach can actually be pretty annoying, loud, or even scary- If you didn't join the company early enough to get a parking spot, you have to park in a lot 1 mile away and take a (free) shuttle to the office.

Its a great opportunity to do full stack development where you are allowed to work on features end to end. There is a strong sense of ownership and commitment to deliver features. Every team has a good mix of junior and senior developers. Since it is such a small team and the product is growing continuously, there are plenty of opportunities to showcase your potential and grow.- Work: Because of the unique and ephemeral nature of the product, the work is really challenging and interesting. It's good to have your entire day focussed on solving the problem as I spend less than 30 minutes a day on emails and meetings. It also allows me to get work done quickly and leave early.- Office space: Although, I was initially skeptical about working in an office space right by the beach, I have started to really like it now. Its literally a beach house transferred to office space and it has all the amenities with an amazing view from the roof top and the deck. Whenever I see myself getting stuck in a problem, I tend to go for a walk by the beach to the shore and refresh myself. Sometimes, we just go out and relax ourselves with a game of volley ball. The office staff are really kind and there is security people in and around the building 24X7.- Food: It's really great that I can turn up at work and not worry about cooking lunch or dinner as food is prepared by the chef daily and the entire team has lunch together. If you want to eat outside, there is also an option to eat at a few handpicked restaurants just by showing your badge.- Transparency: Every engineering team meets with the leadership team on weekly basis where we are told about all the different things happening within the company - new features, growth, monetization strategy, etc. It is quite amazing to see the level of business details shared with the engineering team.- Compensation: The base pay is comparable to any other top tech companies and no other tech company can match the equity portion provided here.",- Staying at Venice can be a little expensive- Continued growth means that the cafeteria is getting crowded during lunch and dinner. It might be worth considering having another one.- Easier to get distracted by events happening at the beach.,Keep up the good work and ensure that the culture of snapchat remains intact as we continue to grow.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Snap-Reviews-E671946.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Snap-RVW6362972.htm

74," Mar 10, 2018",empReview_19623292,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,I worked at Snap full-time (More than a year),The Culture is Broken. The Morale is Sinking.,"1) You will meet some of the brightest and kindest co-workers in your journey. They are incredibly creative and fun to be work with. For many employees (especially those who are new), they come in motivated and ready to change the way we see the camera and the way we communicate.2) Although it's slowly diminishing, there is still high potential for the company. The world is truly Snap's oyster and if they turn the ship, it can shape how we create content, how we communicate and how we engage with the social world.3) The benefits are among the best I've seen. Several cafeteria options in Venice and ample options in the form of Meal Cards elsewhere. Health insurance is 100% paid for. Fully loaded kitchen with plenty of snacks, drinks, beer, cold brew, etc. Compensation is relatively generous depending on your position (not all). And beyond that, there are plenty of smaller things in your benefits package that many don't take advantage of -- One Medical membership, gym discounts, etc. They have a structure that wants to promote kindness to all of its employees.4) CEO is a true visionary.","Sounds like a lot of good stuff, right? Each of the above points have a counterpoint that makes many things null and void.1) Some of the brightest and kindest co-workers in your journey will be passed over for promotions and raises. They will be taken advantage of. Often times, especially in the past few years, they will be let go. There are many employees who come in motivated and energized, competent to change the way things are done. But by the time you're leaving Snap, their energy is drained, their vision is beaten down, and their voice is rendered mute. I've seen Snap slowly drain the life and the soul of some of the smartest minds in the business. They work nights and weekends for a project only for the executive leadership to make a U-turn. Meanwhile, I've seen some of the least deserving employees be given promotions because they simply know how to play the political game very well. This is true for many companies, but trust me when I say it is especially true here.2) Potential is all that is.. potential. Unrealized potential is a frustrating morale killer. Another review mentioned this before, but it is not a fast-moving company. It is fast-moving in the sense that exec leadership may surprise you with new product developments that will force you to cram your work. But it is slow-moving in terms of your ideas (any ideas below the highest exec levels) getting in the pipeline. Often times, Snap is a place that moves 2 steps forward, 4 steps back. I honestly hope this changes. Nothing would make me happier to see leadership turn the ship and realize that potential. There was a reason I signed up years ago.3) The benefits are great, but as you will soon find out in many tech companies and start-ups... great perks are often a band-aid to cover up much more cancerous issues underneath. The culture and morale of a team is built from the top-down. Unfortunately, Snap's culture is built on secrecy, belittlement, threatening emails and ignorance. Often times, their programs and their perks do not fix the true issues of their company.Example 1: Following criticism of tech world's lack of diversity, everyone had to attend a mandatory diversity training course. But if you check out the true decision makers... well, you can do your own research. Changes in diversity and inclusion start from the top and start with how you hire those in positions of power.... not with a 1-hour course.Example 2: They talk about family being an important part of Snap's culture. They even have Make-a-Wish programs that help certain employees in deep need. But on the day-to-day, they are a company that outwardly has said does not believe in work-life balance. That is not just denied. That is amplified. In addition, I've seen co-workers whose spouses and mothers were escorted out of the office like they were fired (for security reasons). Soooo... family is super important except work is more important and we will walk them out without dignity or respect.4) As the company grows, more people must be put in positions of leadership and power. Unfortunately, several of these leaders are unavailable, unqualified and awful people managers. Most importantly, several leaders don't have real power to change anything. They hear the ideas and the complaints of their direct reports, only to scream that feedback into an abyss that highest levels of upper management does not hear or respect.A few other notes:-- People do not trust the HR department here.-- There is no logic to the decision-making here or little transparency in the decision-making.-- I'll echo another review here: Contractors beware.-- Job security is always low.-- Exceptions are always made for those in power. They want to appear to have a flat structure, but it's more like a plateau, a true disconnect from the top and everyone else.","Ask yourself if the culture is broken and if the morale is low. Ask those outside your inner circle, away from the yes-men and yes-women to see if they believe the culture is broken and if the morale is low. Since there is a culture of fear in your company, make sure that you are asking them in the right way.Afterwards, ask yourself who is responsible for that low morale and that broken culture. If you want to blame those below you and keep rotating them out of the company, sure. But do some soul searching and ask if maybe it's the upper management who has failed to lead the right way. And then, don't just acknowledge it to yourself. Change the way things are done. Show more humility. Do your best to close the divide from the top and everyone else.",2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Snap-Reviews-E671946.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Snap-RVW19623292.htm

Priorities shift literally everyday and are based on nothing more than gut feelings.- Slow moving: Any reviewers that say Snap is fast-paced are disillusioned or lack experience. Meetings are for show, constantly pushed out, cancelled, and/or never re-scheduled. There’s very little autonomy and projects are micromanaged. There are no performance reviews, so goals (if they are even articulated) are constantly refreshed or pushed out quarter over quarter.- Morale is low and the existing culture perpetuates this: Some long-timers aren’t receptive to meeting new people as the company grows and bringing them into the fold. It’s a “fend for yourself” environment where survival of the ruthless reigns. Some people are just mean/rude.- Internal Communication: Nope. There is none. Have a suggestion for a new product/feature? Or maybe an anecdot to share that will help boost engagement? You’re out of luck finding a forum to share it in. The only feedback is in the form of app feedback and even that is a black box to the person who reports.Basically, Snap is a place where you try to look as busy possible and impress Evan/your leadership, without actually doing anything that’s moving the “camera company” forward in a meaningful way.It’s been very disappointing working here.
